# Nessus Vulnerability Management Lab — Apache 2.4.x

A hands-on vulnerability management lab using Nessus Essentials.  
This project demonstrates the full workflow of identifying, analyzing, intentionally exposing, and remediating vulnerabilities on a Linux host running an insecure Apache 2.4 web server.

## 🎯 Lab Objectives
1. Install Apache 2.4 on Ubuntu  
2. Introduce intentional misconfigurations  
3. Run an initial Nessus vulnerability scan  
4. Analyze CVSS scores & prioritize remediation  
5. Harden and patch Apache  
6. Run a post-remediation scan  
7. Validate risk reduction  
8. Document results, screenshots, and lessons learned
